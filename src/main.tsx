No, but are you fucking kidding me? This is not what is in my main, it is completely different. Are you fucking kidding me?import {StrictMode} from 'react';
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.tsx';
import './index.css';

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
);
